I am currently studying Videojogos at Universidade Lusófona de Humanidades e 
Tecnologias in Lisbon, Portugal. I specialise in game programming in C# and Unity.

I have experience with both 2D and 3D, however I'm more well-versed in Unity's
2D features. I also have some experience working with Unity's UI system.
